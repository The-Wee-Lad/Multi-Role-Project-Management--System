Project: Multi-Role Project Management System

Goal-
Build a robust REST API for a Project Management System where companies can manage users, projects, and tasks, with strict role-based access and multi-tenancy.

Tech Stack-
Node.js with Express.js
MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
JWT (with refresh token support)
dotenv for environment config
Postman or Swagger for API documentation

Entities & Relationships
1. Company-name, domain
2. User-name, email, password (hashed), role (Admin | Manager | Member)
   belongs to one company
3. Project-name, description, createdBy (User), companyId
4. Task-title, description, status (To Do | In Progress | Done)
    assignedTo (User), projectId

Functional Requirements-
Multi-tenancy: Users can only access data from their own company.
Authentication: JWT-based login + refresh token.
Authorization:
   a. Admin: Full access to all company data.
   b. Manager: Can manage projects & tasks, but not users.
   c. Member: Can view and update assigned tasks only.

CRUD Operations:
	Companies: register & setup
	Users: create (admin only), list (by company), login, refresh tokens
	Projects: CRUD by Admin & Manager
	Tasks: CRUD by Admin & Manager; Members can update their assigned tasks

Pagination on listing endpoints.

Search/Filter: Tasks by status and assignee.

Validation: Use Joi or express-validator.

Additional Requirements
Rate Limiting (per IP using express-rate-limit)
Centralized Error Handling middleware
Async/Await + Promises â€“ avoid callbacks
Modular folder structure (routes, controllers, services, models)
Basic unit tests using Jest or Mocha for at least 2 modules (e.g., Auth and Project APIs)

Bonus-
Dockerize the app with docker-compose for MongoDB
Implement audit logging (e.g., user X updated task Y at time Z)
CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions or similar

Expected Deliverables
GitHub repo with:
README with setup instructions and API usage
Postman collection or Swagger UI link
.env.example

Code should be clean, readable, and modular
